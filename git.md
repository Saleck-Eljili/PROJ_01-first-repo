# Git: Version Control System

Git is a widely-used distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project efficiently and helps manage codebase versions. Git is known for its speed, flexibility, and robust branching capabilities.

## Key Concepts

### Repository (Repo)

A Git repository is a directory where all the project's files and version history are stored. There can be a local repository on your computer and remote repositories hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

### Commit

A commit is a snapshot of the codebase at a specific point in time. Developers create commits to save their changes along with a commit message that describes what was done.

### Branch

A branch is a separate line of development. Developers can create branches to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Branches can be merged back into the main branch when the work is complete.

### Pull Request (PR)

A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch (usually a feature branch) into another (typically the main branch). It allows for code review and discussion before merging.

### Clone

To clone a repository means to make a copy of it on your local machine. This is often the first step when starting work on a project.

## Getting Started with Git

To start using Git, you'll need to:

1. **Install Git**: Download and install Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or use a package manager for your operating system.

2. **Configure Git**: Set your name and email address in Git using the following commands:

   ```shell
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
