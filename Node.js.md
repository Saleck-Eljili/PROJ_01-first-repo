# Node.js

Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on Google's V8 JavaScript engine. It enables developers to create fast and scalable server applications using JavaScript, a language primarily known for the client side. Here are some important features of Node.js:

- **Non-blocking and Asynchronous**: Node.js uses a non-blocking programming model, making it efficient for I/O-intensive operations.

- **NPM Ecosystem**: Node.js relies on the NPM package manager, providing access to thousands of third-party libraries and modules.

- **Ideal for Real-time Applications**: Node.js is commonly used for real-time applications such as chat apps, online games, and live dashboards.
